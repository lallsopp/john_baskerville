<h1>Streats- Case study</h1>
<h2>Aim:</h2>

<p>The aim of this project was to create an app related to travel.</p>

<h2>My idea:</h2>
<p>My idea was to create an app that aids people in discovering different street food around the world. The app would access your location and bring up different street foods and where to get it or you could search different places in the world out of curiosity. The app also shows an illustration of the traditional street food and gives an estimate of a typical price for it and also tells how it is made/ what it is made with.</p>

<h2>Process:</h2>
<p>In order to create this app i carried out research. I began buy searching different street foods around the world, I also used social media platforms such as instagram to further explore the different food and what they would typically look like. I then looked further into the different foods and the processes of how they are made. </p>

<P>I then looked to food illustrations for inspiration and to get a better grasp on what it was exactly that i was hoping to go for. 
I began to sketch out rough ideas for the layout and illustrations and started to think of a brand for my app. </P>

<p>For my brand name i wanted to follow a street art type logo and create a logo that somewhat resembled graffiti. As graffiti is often done with bright colours i then opted for a colour scheme that also exhibited a range of bright colours. However i reworked my colour scheme slightly and toned down the colours as i found they were quite hard to look at. </p>
<p>When i began to design my screens digitally i struggled with the layout. I created 3 screens for my app and then reworked it all. The first screens i designed lacked a flow throughout and it was hard to see which screen followed which. I also lacked call to action buttons making the app difficult to understand or use.</p>


<h2>Outcome:</h2>

<p>For my final outcome i added more 'in between' screens to create a better structure for the app and give a better sense of how it would work. I struggled with what to do for a home screen, so i began to research different types of icecream and food menus. for my homescreen i went with the icecream menu idea that would be displayed on the side of an icecream van, with each call to action button based around a price sign.</p>

<p>From looking back at my app i realise there are a few changes i would make. For example; I would make the list of places menu easier to navigate by adding a search bar instead of a long list. I also feel like the layout could still do with a bit of work as it looks quite messy.</p>

<h1>Infographic - Case Study</h1>
    
<h2>Aim:</h2>

<P>The aim of this project was to create an illustrated piece of work with information throughout.</P>

<h2>My Idea:</h2>

<p>My idea was surrounding india and the poverty/employment within the country.</p>

<h2>Process:</h2>

<p>To begin gaining a perspective on what exactly i wanted to showcase i started to research about India and the different aspects which are a problem within the country. I then began to narrow down the information i wanted to add as there were alot of different things that could've been included but didn't quite relate.
Once i had gathered all the research and figures i needed i began to sketch out layouts for the infographic. I then went on to start to sketch illustrations that i might want to include.</p>
<p>Once i moved to digital i realised that i wanted to go in a different direction with my illustrations. I began to illustrate more complex illustrations which i then used in the background and around the sides. I also went for a cityscape of india at the top with landmarks to bring attention to exactly what the infographic was based on. </p>

<p>As India is known for its traditional bright colours i followed this colourscheme within my infographic, however I later changed this as the colours were over powering and took away from the background illustrations. I toned down the colours but still stuck with bright colours as i wanted the colours to stand out from the black background.</p>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
    
<p>When designing my graphs i found it challenging to scale the different parts of the graph according to the figures. I also had to rework a few graphs as they were too large or didnt flow with the rest of the infographic.</p>

<h2>Outcome:</h2>

<P>I was pleased with the final outcome as I think i showed a good amount of information along with interesting illustrations.
However I realise some illustrations were placed badly, for example; i placed an illustration behind a graph which is distracting and somewhat misleading. I would also possible narrow my information down to be based around 1 topic as i feel i tried to fit too much in and may have created a more effective infographic if i had've looked more thoroughly into one topic.  </P>

<h1>Brand Guidelines - Case Study</h1>
    
<h2>Aim:</h2>
<p>The aim of this project was to create a set of guidelines to insure the correct use of my personal brand. Which included the use of my monogram, wordmark and visual marque.</p>

<h2>Process:</h2>
<p>To begin outlining exactly how i wanted my brand to be used i had to figure out myself how i wanted my brand to look and the consistency I wanted throughout my brand.</p> 

<p>To do this i researched other brand guidelines and looked at how brands kept consistency throughout their brand and also the layout they used to display their guidelines. </p>
<p>When i began to outline my guidelines they looked like a boring word document with little colour and no excitement around them. I had to rework my layout and how i wanted it to look to create a more interesting document inkeeping with the style of my brand. I also struggled with the typeface i wanted to use as i also changed my wordmark a few times and therefore had to rework my guidelines in turn. </p>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<p>When outlining my guidelines i also struggled to decipher what my values and aims were and found myself spending a lot of time trying to figure them out. </p>

<h2>Outcome:</h2>

<p>After reworking my layout and researching more about values and aims i am pleased with how my brand guidelines turned out. Although I think there are parts that couldâ€™ve been done differently and slightly better. For example; after changing the typeface of my wordmark i accidentally missed page 19 and left it in the original font.</p>
